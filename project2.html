    <h1>Advanced Port Scanner Tool</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>This tool allows you to scan open ports and detect services on a target IP, providing valuable insights into network vulnerabilities and available services.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why is this Tool Useful?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Advanced Port Scanner Tool</strong> is a powerful utility that helps network administrators and security professionals assess the status of ports and services running on a remote machine. Hereâ€™s why this tool is indispensable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> It allows you to identify open ports that could be vulnerable to exploits or attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Detection:</strong> It provides banners for various services (e.g., HTTP, SSH, FTP) running on open ports, which helps to identify the services and their versions.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Port Scanning:</strong> The tool scans multiple ports quickly using threading, enabling fast detection of services across a range of ports.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Ensure that the devices or servers you are scanning are within your legal rights to inspect, keeping your network assessments ethical and compliant.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How to Use the Tool</h2>
        <p>Using this tool is easy! Follow the steps below to get started:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Choose a Task:</strong> When prompted, choose what you'd like to do:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check Host Availability:</strong> Verify if a specific host (IP address) is reachable for further enumeration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scan Ports:</strong> Enter a target IP and specify the port range to scan for open ports and services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exit:</strong> Exit the tool when you're done.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enter Target IP:</strong> Input the IP address of the host you wish to check or scan.</li>
            <li><strong>Specify Port Range:</strong> For scanning ports, provide the start and end ports to scan within a specified range.</li>
            <li><strong>Review Results:</strong> Once the scan is complete, review the results to see which ports are open and the services they are running.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Explanation of the Tool</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Advanced Port Scanner Tool</strong> is built using Python, making it versatile and easy to run on most operating systems. It works in the following way:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Host Discovery:</strong> The tool starts by verifying if the target host is reachable via a simple ping test.</li>
            <li><strong>Port Scanning:</strong> It scans each port in the specified range using multi-threading to speed up the process. It checks if each port is open and tries to fetch a service banner if available.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Detection:</strong> For certain ports (like HTTP, SSH, FTP), it attempts to grab a banner to identify the service and its version, which helps in further security assessments.</li>
            <li><strong>Retries and Timeout Handling:</strong> If a connection to a port fails or times out, the tool retries multiple times (with customizable retries) before reporting the port as closed or unreachable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, this tool provides a comprehensive way to analyze the open ports and services on a target machine, helping you with network management and security audits.</p>
